# AlarmClockC

An alarm clock that I wrote in C based off my ruby alarm clock.

- There is no audio file playing capabilities yet, I was looking into the FMOD API and stuff but gave up for now. 
  If I can play audio in another project sometime I will update it to work, but for the time being this is it.
